Machine learning project for predicting the number of customer orders using historical e-commerce data with regression models.
# Number of Orders Prediction (Demand Forecasting)
## Overview
This project predicts customer order volumes using historical data to support demand forecasting and inventory planning.
## Dataset
Includes date, product category, price, discount, marketing activity, and order count. Additional date-based features were added.
## Tools and Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
## Key Steps
- Cleaned and prepared dataset
- Encoded categorical features
- Engineered date features
- Trained Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Evaluated using RMSE, MAE, R²
- Visualized actual vs predicted data
## Outcome
Built an accurate demand forecasting model helpful for business decision-making.
